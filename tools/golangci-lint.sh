# golangci-lint wrapper script
# Ensures consistent lint behavior across development and CI environments.
#
# Checks the VERSION, not merely the presence, of the binary. Checking presence
# alone means a different version already on PATH silently wins -- which is how
# CI can fail a lint that passed locally, on a rule the older binary does not
# have. Keep GOLANGCI_LINT_VERSION in lockstep with .github/workflows/ci.yaml.
#
# It also checks the Go release the binary was BUILT with against the local
# toolchain. A golangci-lint built with an older Go panics with "file requires
# newer Go version" when the toolchain moves on, even when its own version is
# right, so that case reinstalls too.
